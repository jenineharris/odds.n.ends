## odds.n.ends

The `odds.n.ends` package takes a `glm()` object and returns:

* odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals
* sensitivity and specificity
* percent correctly predicted 
* visual display of predicted probabilities
* ROC curves

Arguments can change the threshold for predicting an observation into the 0 (no/control) or 1 (yes/case) category, add the ROC curve to the output, and change the colors used in the visual displays. 

Version 0.1.4 is available on CRAN as of September 20, 2021.
